A minimalist starter for React, React-three-fiber and Threejs in Typescript.

This starter allows you to navigate seamlessly between pages with dynamic dom and/or canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time.

### How to use

#### Installation

_Tailwind is the default style. styled-components (styled) is also available._


### :passport_control: Typescript



### :memo: Note:

**Regarding the new layout system in next@13**:

While the app directory is still in beta we are still investigating on the layout implementation, but for now it's more stable to use pages.
An alternative branch will be available in the near future with the app directory architecture. It will be accessible through the starter CLI. Contribution is welcome
[Follow the progress of layout implementation here.](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-next/issues/103)

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **canvas** property to the parent component.

```jsx
export default function Page(props) {
  return <div>Hello !</div>
}
// Canvas contents go here
// It will receive same props as Page component (from getStaticProps, etc.)
Page.canvas = (props) => (
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry />
    <meshBasicMaterial color='hotpink' />
  </mesh>
)
```
